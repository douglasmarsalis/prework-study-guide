# Rice University Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- As a boot camp student,
I want the pre-work notes to be structured on a webpage,
So that I can easily find and read the information.
- I want an easy location to refer to when I have some questions about my work or need to look up some old information.
- This webpage will give me quick means of finding my answers to my questions.
- By building this webpage, it also helped me to learn inforamtion on HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Javascript, README markdown information, and Deployment.
